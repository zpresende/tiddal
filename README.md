# Zé Pedro Resende

## 👋🏼 Hi there

I'm a fullstack developer with a passion for code, clean code.

I just love when "code reads like prose" and that's why I'm investing so much time on Software Architecture and Clean Code.

My background as an orchestra musician and a football player helped me become a great team member, a leader and an extremely organized person. I’m always searching the best ways to perform a certain task and I always look forward to share that knowledge with those around me as well as my energy and my commitment. I aspire to be the best Developer that I can be.

The stack I use is all about JavaScript, so I'm all about mastering TypeScript and use it in React, React Native and backend development with NodeJS to create amazing web and mobile applications. I'm also really interested in system architecture being microservices and containers with Docker and Kubernetes.

As a sports enthusiast I'm extremely competitive and perfectionist. Inspired by Kobe Bryant, the Mamba Mentality is in everything that I do and mark my words: I will be the best developer that I can be.

I created a project called Synxty where I plan to talk about mental health, clean code, good software architecture and design and to provide tools to help people starting their developer journey the right way and also help current developers to get better, so we are all in sync.
